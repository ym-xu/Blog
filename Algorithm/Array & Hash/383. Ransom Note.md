## Note
### Method 1: Hash

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
        hash_m = {}

        for i in magazine:
            hash_m[i] = 1 + hash_m.get(i, 0)

        for i in ransomNote:
            if i not in hash_m:
                return False
            else:
                hash_m[i] -= 1
                if hash_m[i] < 0:
                    return False

        return True
```
#### Analysis
##### Time Complexity: $O(n)$
##### Space Complexity: $O(1)$
because k is never more than 26, which is a constant, it'd be reasonable to say that this algorithm requires O(1) space.
