## Note
### Method 1: Hash
  
If n is not a happy number, it **enters an endless cycle** that does not include 1. Therefore, we can create a set. If new_n is in the set, return False; if new_n equals 1, return True.
#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        check = set()

        while n not in check:
            str_n = str(n)
            check.add(n)
            new = 0
            for i in str_n:
                new += int(i) * int(i)

            if new == 1: return True
            else: n = new
        return False
```
#### Analysis
##### Time Complexity: $O(logn)$
##### Space Complexity: $O(logn)$
