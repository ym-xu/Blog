## Note
### Method 1
In this problem, we should control the logic of traversing the interval, if n % 2 == 1, we should append the central to the result.
#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def generateMatrix(self, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        res = [[0] * n for i in range(n)]
        loop = n // 2
        count = 1
        
        for offset in range(0, loop + 1) :

            # l -> r
            for i in range(offset, n - offset - 1):
                res[offset][i] = count
                count += 1
            # t -> b
            for i in range(offset, n - offset - 1):
                res[i][n - offset - 1] = count
                count += 1
            # r -> l
            for i in range(offset, n - offset - 1):
                res[n - offset - 1][n - i - 1] = count
                count += 1
            # b -> t
            for i in range(offset, n - offset - 1):
                res[n - i - 1][offset] = count
                count += 1

        if n % 2:
            res[loop][loop] = count
            
        return res
```
#### Analysis
##### Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$
1. The algorithm uses a loop that iterates through the layers of the matrix. The number of layers is approximately `n // 2`.
2. Within each layer, there are four nested loops, each of which runs for `n - 2 * offset - 1` iterations.
3. Therefore, the time complexity of the loops is approximately $O(n^2)$.
4. The overall time complexity is $O(n^2)$.
##### Space Complexity: $O(n^2)$
1. The algorithm uses a 2D list `res` to store the generated matrix. The size of the matrix is `n x n`, so the space complexity is $O(n^2)$.
