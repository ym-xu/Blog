## Note
  
It appears that you are describing a two-pointer approach where a slow pointer and a fast pointer traverse an array. When the fast pointer encounters a value not equal to the target, the value at the fast position is assigned to the slow position.

```python
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        
        l = 0
        f = 0

        while f < len(nums):
            if nums[f] == val:
                f += 1
            else:
                nums[l] = nums[f]
                l += 1
                f += 1
        return l
```
