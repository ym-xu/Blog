## Note
### Method 1: Hash

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def fourSumCount(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int], nums3: List[int], nums4: List[int]) -> int:
        hash_1 = {}
        res = 0

        for i in nums1:
            for j in nums2:
                hash_1[i + j] = 1 + hash_1.get(i+j, 0)

        for i in nums3:
            for j in nums4:
                if (0-i-j) in hash_1:
                    res += hash_1[(0-i-j)]
        
        return res
```
#### Analysis
##### Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$
##### Space Complexity: $O(n^2)$
- The space complexity is determined by the `hash_1` dictionary, which stores the sum of all possible pairs from `nums1` and `nums2` as keys and their frequency as values.
- The dictionary may have at most $O(n^2)$ unique keys.
- Therefore, the space complexity is $O(n^2)$.
