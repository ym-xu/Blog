## Note

### Method 1: heap + queue

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        
        count = Counter(tasks)

        maxheap = [-c for c in count.values()]

        heapq.heapify(maxheap)

        time = 0
        q = deque()

        while maxheap or q:
            time += 1

            if maxheap:
                c = 1 + heapq.heappop(maxheap)
                if c:
                    q.append([c, time + n])

            if q and q[0][1] == time:
                heapq.heappush(maxheap, q.popleft()[0])

        return time 

```
#### Analysis
##### Time Complexity: $O(N + M*logM)$
1. Constructing the `count` dictionary using `Counter(tasks)` takes O(N), where N is the number of tasks.
2. Constructing the `maxheap` takes O(M * log M), where M is the number of unique tasks and log M is the time complexity of heapify.
3. The while loop runs until both `maxheap` and `q` are empty. In each iteration, we perform operations like `heappop`, `heappush`, and `popleft`. These operations have a time complexity of O(log M) and O(1) respectively.
4. The overall time complexity is dominated by the `while` loop, and it is O(N + M * log M).
##### Space Complexity: $O(M + N)$
1. The `count` dictionary requires O(M) space, where M is the number of unique tasks.
2. The `maxheap` list stores the negative counts of each task, and its size is proportional to the number of unique tasks. Therefore, the space complexity is O(M).
3. The `q` deque stores information about tasks that need to wait for the cooling period. In the worst case, it can store all tasks, so its space complexity is O(N).
4. The overall space complexity is O(M + N).
