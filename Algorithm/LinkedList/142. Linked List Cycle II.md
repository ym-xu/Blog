## Note

### Method 1: Math
As shown in the picture below, we use two pointers: slow and fast. In each step, slow moves one step, and fast moves two steps. If they meet, the list has a cycle. 
When the two pointers meet, the fast pointer took x + y + n(y + z) steps, and the slow pointer took x + y steps:
$x + y + n(y + z) = (x + y) * 2$  # fast = fast.next.next, slow = slow.next
$n(y + z) = x + y$
$n(y + z) - y= x$
$(n - 1)(y + z) + z= x, n = [1,...]$ 
$z= x$ # n = 1
If we find the meeting point, set a new pointer, new_point = head, and move it together with the fast_point. When new_point moves x steps and fast_point moves z (z = x) steps, we find the result point.

#### Code
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
        lf = 0
        ll = 0

        curr_f = head
        curr_l = head

        while curr_f and curr_f.next:
            curr_f = curr_f.next.next
            curr_l = curr_l.next

            if curr_f == curr_l:
                new_l = head
                while curr_f != new_l:
                    new_l = new_l.next
                    curr_f = curr_f.next
                return curr_f

        return None
```

##### Time Complexity: $O(n)$
##### Space Complexity: $O(1)$
