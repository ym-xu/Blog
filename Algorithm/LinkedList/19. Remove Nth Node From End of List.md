## Note

### Method 1: One pass algorithm
Create slow and fast pointers. Initially, move the fast pointer n+1 steps. After that, move both pointers together. When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the node preceding our target node.
#### Code
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
        dummy_head = ListNode()
        dummy_head.next = head

        fast = dummy_head
        slow = dummy_head

        for i in range(n + 1):
            fast = fast.next

        while fast:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next

        slow.next = slow.next.next

        return dummy_head.next
```
#### Analysis
##### Time Complexity: $O(n)$
##### Space Complexity: $O(1)$

### Method 1: Two pass algorithm
First, iterate through the list to determine its length. Then, use a second loop to find the (N-1)th last node.
#### Code
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
        length = 0

        curr = head

        while curr:
            length += 1
            curr = curr.next

        dummy_head = ListNode()
        dummy_head.next = head

        curr = dummy_head

        for i in range(length - n):
            curr = curr.next

        curr.next = curr.next.next

        return dummy_head.next
```
