## Note
### Method 1: Two Pointer, Get lengths and traverse
Obtain the lengths first, then move the pointer of the longer list by the difference in lengths, as shown in the picture. This ensures that the remaining lengths of both lists are the same. Now, move both pointers together and compare the corresponding nodes.

#### Code
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
        l1 = l2 = 0

        curr1 = headA
        curr2 = headB

        while curr1:
            curr1 = curr1.next
            l1 += 1

        while curr2:
            curr2 = curr2.next
            l2 += 1

        curr1 = headA
        curr2 = headB

        if l1 > l2:
            for i in range(l1 - l2):
                curr1 = curr1.next

            while curr1:
                if curr1 == curr2:
                    return curr1
                curr1 = curr1.next
                curr2 = curr2.next
        else:
            for i in range(l2 - l1):
                    curr2 = curr2.next

            while curr2:
                if curr1 == curr2:
                    return curr1
                curr1 = curr1.next
                curr2 = curr2.next
