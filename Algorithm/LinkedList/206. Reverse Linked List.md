## Note

### Method 1:  Iterative
Initialize a 'prev' node. Iterate through all nodes in the linked list, capturing the next node at each step. Update the 'next' pointer of the current node to point to the 'prev' node. Move forward in the iteration by updating 'prev' to the current node and 'curr' to the next node. This process effectively reverses the linked list, with 'prev' becoming the new head after the iteration.
#### Code
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head:
            return 
            
        prev = None
        curr = head

        while curr:
            temp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = temp
        
        return prev
```
#### Analysis
##### Time Complexity: $O(n)$
##### Space Complexity: $O(1)$
