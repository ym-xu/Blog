## Note

### Method 1: Dummy Head
Create a placeholder head named 'dummy' and link it to the actual head. Begin traversing(遍历) the linked list starting from the head (current pointer), with the dummy head serving as the previous pointer. Move both pointers together to the next element. If the current node's value (curr.val) matches the specified value (val), update the next pointer of the previous node (prev.next) to skip the current node (curr.next)
#### Code
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeElements(self, head: Optional[ListNode], val: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
        dummy_head = ListNode()
        dummy_head.next = head

        curr = head
        prev = dummy_head

        while curr:
            if curr.val == val:
                prev.next = curr.next
            else:
                prev = curr
                
            curr = curr.next

        return dummy_head.next
```
#### Analysis
##### Time Complexity: $O(n)$
##### Space Complexity: $O(1)$
