## Note

### Method 1

#### Code
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class MyLinkedList:

    def __init__(self):
        self.dummy_head = ListNode()
        self.size = 0        

    def get(self, index: int) -> int:
        if index < 0 or index > self.size - 1:
            return -1

        curr = self.dummy_head.next
        for i in range(index):
            curr = curr.next

        return curr.val

    def addAtHead(self, val: int) -> None:

        new_node = ListNode(val)
        new_node.next = self.dummy_head.next
        self.dummy_head.next = new_node
        self.size += 1

    def addAtTail(self, val: int) -> None:

        curr = self.dummy_head

        while curr.next != None:
            curr = curr.next

        curr.next = ListNode(val, next = None)
        
        self.size += 1

    def addAtIndex(self, index: int, val: int) -> None:
        
        if index < 0 or index > self.size:
            return

        curr = self.dummy_head

        for i in range(index):
            curr = curr.next

        curr.next = ListNode(val, next = curr.next)

        self.size += 1

    def deleteAtIndex(self, index: int) -> None:

        if index < 0 or index > self.size - 1:
            return

        curr = self.dummy_head

        for i in range(index):
            curr = curr.next

        curr.next = curr.next.next

        self.size -= 1
        


# Your MyLinkedList object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyLinkedList()
# param_1 = obj.get(index)
# obj.addAtHead(val)
# obj.addAtTail(val)
# obj.addAtIndex(index,val)
# obj.deleteAtIndex(index)
```
#### Analysis
1. **get(index: int) -> int:**
    
    - **Time Complexity:** O(min(index, size - index)): In the worst case, it might iterate through the entire list, either starting from the head or from the tail, whichever is closer to the target index.
    - **Space Complexity:** O(1): No extra space is used.
2. **addAtHead(val: int) -> None:**
    
    - **Time Complexity:** O(1): It inserts a new node at the beginning of the list, and the time complexity is constant.
    - **Space Complexity:** O(1): No extra space is used.
3. **addAtTail(val: int) -> None:**
    
    - **Time Complexity:** O(size): In the worst case, it might iterate(迭代) through the entire list to reach the tail.
    - **Space Complexity:** O(1): No extra space is used.
4. **addAtIndex(index: int, val: int) -> None:**
    
    - **Time Complexity:** O(min(index, size - index)): In the worst case, it might iterate through the list to the target index.
    - **Space Complexity:** O(1): No extra space is used.
5. **deleteAtIndex(index: int) -> None:**
    
    - **Time Complexity:** O(min(index, size - index)): In the worst case, it might iterate through the list to the target index.
    - **Space Complexity:** O(1): No extra space is used.
