## Note
First, sort elements by $x[0]$, if the $curr[i][0]$ > $curr[i-1][1]$, that means we can't burst the two balloons by one arrow. If $curr[i][0]$ <= $curr[i-1][1]$, that means we can burst them by one arrow, then we need to update the right border of current element, that will be the minimum value of $curr[i-1][1]$ and $curr[i][1]$.

```python
class Solution:
    def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if len(points) == 0:
            return 0
        points.sort(key=lambda x : x[0])

        res = 1

        for i in range(1, len(points)):
            if points[i][0] > points[i-1][1]:
                res += 1
            else:
                points[i][1] = min(points[i - 1][1], points[i][1])

        return res
```
## Analysis
### Time Complexity: $O(nlogn)$
1. Sort: $O(nlogn)$
2. Traverse array: $O(n)$
### Space Complexity: $O(n)$
1. `list.sort()` function in Python is implemented with the [Timsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort)algorithm whose space complexity is $O(n)$.
