## Note

In this computational challenge, we are presented with two arrays: 'g,' representing the greed factor of children, and 's,' representing the available cookies. The objective is to maximize the number of satisfied children by strategically allocating cookies. By sorting both arrays in ascending order, we can efficiently match larger cookies with children exhibiting higher greed levels, thereby optimizing the overall contentment of the children.
### Method 1: Greedy

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findContentChildren(self, g: List[int], s: List[int]) -> int:

        res = 0

        g.sort()
        s.sort()
        idx_s = len(s) - 1

        for i in range(len(g)-1, -1, -1):
            if idx_s >= 0 and g[i] <= s[idx_s]:
                res += 1
                idx_s -= 1

        return res
```
#### Analysis
##### Time Complexity: $O(nlogn)$
1. Sorting: The sorting of arrays 'g' and 's' has a time complexity of O(N log N), where N is the length of the larger array between 'g' and 's'.
2. Iteration: The iteration over the 'g' array has a time complexity of O(N), where N is the length of the 'g' array.
##### Space Complexity: $O(n)$
1. Sorting: The sorting operation typically has a space complexity of O(1) if the sorting is done in-place. However, the space complexity may vary depending on the sorting algorithm used. In the case of Python's built-in sorting function (Timsort), it has a space complexity of O(N) due to auxiliary storage for the merge step.
2. Other variables: The variables 'res' and 'idx_s' consume constant space.
