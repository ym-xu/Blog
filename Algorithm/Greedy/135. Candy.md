## Note
We split our solution into two steps:
1. Create a "res" array where each child initially has one candy.
2. Traverse from left to right, and for each position, check if the left neighbor's rating is smaller than the current child's rating. If true, add 1 to the current child's candy count.
3. Traverse from right to left, and for each position, check if the right neighbor's rating is smaller than the current child's rating. If true, assign the maximum value between (res[i+1] + 1) and res[i] to the current child's candy count.

```python
class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        
        res = [1] * len(ratings)
        for i in range(1, len(res)):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i-1]:
                res[i] = res[i-1] + 1

        for i in range(len(res) - 2, -1, -1):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i+1]:
                res[i] = max(res[i+1] + 1, res[i])

        return sum(res)
```
## Analysis
### Time Complexity $O(n)$
1. First traverse: $O(n)$
2. Second traverse: $O(n)$
3. Sum:  $O(n)$
### Space Complexity $O(n)$
1. Create res array: $O(n)$
