## Note
This problem shares similarities with [[135. Candy|135. Candy]] in that it involves two metrics, and it's beneficial to address them separately.

We have two metrics: $h$ and $k$, where $h_i$ represents the height of the i-th person, and $k_i$ represents the count of persons with $h >= h_i$ in front. We can initially sort the queue based on h in descending order, and for elements with the same $h$, sort them in ascending order of $k$. After this sorting, we can rearrange the elements according to their $k$ values. Since the queue is sorted, relocating $element_i$ to position $k_i$ ensures that there are exactly $k_i$ elements with $h >= h_i$ in front of it.
### Algorithm
1. Sort people:
    - In descending order by height.
    - Among the guys of the same height, in the ascending order by k-values.
2. Take guys one by one, and place them in the output array at the indexes equal to their k-values.
3. Return output array.

```python
class Solution:
    def reconstructQueue(self, people: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:

        # sort element first based on -x[0], if have same x[0], sort by x[1]
        people.sort(key = lambda x: (-x[0], x[1]))

        res = []

        for p in people:
            res.insert(p[1], p)

        return res
```

## Analysis
### Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$
1. Sorted: $O(nlogn)$
2. Relocated elements: $O(n^2)$
### Space Complexity: $O(n)$
1. Create res Array: $O(n)$
