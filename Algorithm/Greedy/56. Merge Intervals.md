## Note
### Method 1: Greedy
Sort the elements based on the left board. Then, iterate through the sorted elements and check if the current element overlaps with the previous one. If there is an overlap, merge the two elements.
#### Code
```python
class Solution(object):
    def merge(self, intervals):
        """
        :type intervals: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        intervals=sorted(intervals)

        stack = []
        stack.append(intervals[0][0])
        stack.append(intervals[0][1])

        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            if intervals[i][1] <= stack[-1]:
                continue
            elif intervals[i][0] <= stack[-1]:
                stack.pop()
                stack.append(intervals[i][1])
            else:
                stack.append(intervals[i][0])
                stack.append(intervals[i][1])

        res = []

        while stack:
            a = stack.pop()
            b = stack.pop()
            res.append([b, a])

        return res
```

```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not intervals:
            return 0
        
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            if intervals[i][0] < intervals[i - 1][1]:
                intervals[i][1] = min(intervals[i - 1][1], intervals[i][1])
                count += 1
        
        return count
```
#### Analysis
##### Time Complexity: $O(nlogn)$
1. Sorting the `intervals` array takes O(n log n) time, where n is the length of the input list.
2. The subsequent loop iterates through the sorted intervals once, performing constant-time operations in each iteration. Therefore, its time complexity is O(n).
3. The overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, so it is O(n log n).
##### Space Complexity: $O(n)$
1. The `stack` is used to store the merged intervals. In the worst case, when there are no overlapping intervals, the size of the stack is at most 2n (for each interval, two elements are pushed onto the stack). Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).
2. The `res` list stores the final result, and its space complexity is also O(n), as each interval is represented in the output.
3. The variables `a` and `b` are constant space, as they represent the endpoints of intervals.
4. Overall, the space complexity is O(n).
