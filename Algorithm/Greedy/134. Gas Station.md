## Note
### Brute-force
Intuitively, we traverse the array and, at each station, simulate the entire process with the current station as the starting point. If we return to the current station, we have found the solution. The time complexity of this approach is $O(n^2)$.

```python
class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        
        for i in range(len(gas)):

            rest = gas[i] - cost[i]
            nextidx = (i + 1) % len(gas)

            while rest > 0 and nextidx != i:
                rest += gas[nextidx] - cost[nextidx]
                nextidx = (nextidx + 1) % len(gas)

            if nextidx == i and rest >= 0:
                return i

        return -1
```

### Greedy

station | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| :--: |  :--:  |  :--:  |  :--:  |  :--:  |  :--:  |
gas | 2 | 5 | 2 | 3 | 5 |
cost | 1 | 2 | 8 | 2 | 4 |
curr | 1 | 3 | -6 | 1 | 1 |

In the above table, we calculated the current gas of each station. At station 2, the current gas is a negative number, which means that the previous station cannot be used as the starting point, if there has a start station, it must be after station 2.

#### Algorithm
1. Initialize `curr_gain`, `total_gain` and `start` to 0.
2. Traverse through gas and cost. For each station i, increment total_gain and `curr_gain` by `gas[i] - cost[i]`.
3. If `curr_gain` is smaller than 0, we will test if station `i + 1` is a valid starting station by setting `answer` as `i + 1`, resetting `curr_gain` to 0, and repeating step 2.
4. When the iteration is complete, if `total_gain` is smaller than 0, return -1. Otherwise, return `start`.

```python
class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        
        start = 0
        currsum = 0
        totalsum = 0

        for i in range(len(gas)):
            currsum += gas[i] - cost[i]
            totalsum += gas[i] - cost[i]

            if currsum < 0:
                start = i + 1
                currsum = 0

        if totalsum < 0:
            return -1
        
        return start
```
