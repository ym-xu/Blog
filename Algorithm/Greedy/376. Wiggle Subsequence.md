## Note

### Method 1: Greedy

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def wiggleMaxLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
        if len(nums) < 2:
            return len(nums)

        prevdiff = nums[1] - nums[0]

        res = 2 if prevdiff != 0 else 1

        for i in range(2, len(nums)):
            diff = nums[i] - nums[i - 1]

            if (diff > 0 and prevdiff <= 0) or (diff < 0 and prevdiff >= 0):
                res += 1
                prevdiff = diff

        return res
```
#### Analysis
##### Time Complexity: $O(n)$
Iteration: The loop iterates over the 'nums' array once, and each iteration involves constant-time operations. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the 'nums' array.
##### Space Complexity: $O(1)$
1. Variables: The variables 'prevdiff' and 'res' use constant space.
2. Loop variable: The loop variable 'i' also uses constant space.
