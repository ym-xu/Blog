## Note
### Method 1: Record start and end position and Greedy

This problem is similar to [[452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons|452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons]], for every element, we can record its first and end position, then the solution idea is same as problem 452.
#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def partitionLabels(self, s: str) -> List[int]:
        
        hash_s = {}

        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] not in hash_s:
                hash_s[s[i]] = [i, i]
            else:
                hash_s[s[i]][1] = i
        
        plist = [hash_s[i] for i in hash_s]

        res = []
        rightboard = plist[0][1]
        leftboard = 0
        for i in range(1, len(plist)):
            if plist[i][0] > rightboard:
                res.append(rightboard - leftboard + 1)
                leftboard = plist[i][0]
            rightboard = max(rightboard, plist[i][1])
        res.append(rightboard - leftboard + 1)

        return res
```
#### Analysis
##### Time Complexity: $O(n+m)$
1. First loop: $O(n)$, where n is the number of elements in s
2. Second loop: $O(m)$, where m is the number of elements in hash_s
##### Space Complexity: $O(n)$
1. we create the hash_s: $O(m)$, where m is the number of elements in hash_s

### Method 2: Greedy
Let's try to repeatedly choose the smallest left-justified partition.  
Consider the first label, say it's `'a'`. The first partition must include it, and also the last occurrence of `'a'`.  
However, between those two occurrences of `'a'`, there could be other labels that make the minimum size of this partition bigger. For example, in `"abccaddbeffe"`, the minimum first partition is `"abccaddb"`.  
This gives us the idea for the algorithm: For each letter encountered, process the last occurrence of that letter, extending the current partition `[anchor, j]` appropriately.
#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def partitionLabels(self, s: str) -> List[int]:
        # record the last index of every element
        last = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(s)}
        ans = []
        # create start l, end r
        l, r = 0, 0
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            # the max right board of current partition
            r = max(r, last[c])
            # if r == i, means we get the partition
            if i == r:
                ans.append(i - l + 1)
                l = i + 1
        return ans
```
#### Analysis
##### Time Complexity: $O(n)$
##### Space Complexity: $O(1)$
1. $O(1)$ to keep data structure `last` of not more than 26 characters.
