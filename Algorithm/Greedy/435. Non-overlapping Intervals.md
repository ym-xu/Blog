## Note
### Method 1: Greedy

This problem shares similarities with [[452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons|452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons]]. To solve it, we can sort the array based on the left board of each element. Then, we check for overlapping elements. If an overlap is found, we identify the one to be removed and update the right board to discover additional overlapping cases. When faced with a choice of which overlapping element to remove, we opt for the one with the larger right board. This decision is made because it is more likely to cause further overlaps when checking subsequent elements.

In the code, there is no need to actually delete elements. Instead, we can update the right board of the current element to the minimum of $element[curr][1]$ and $element[curr - 1][1]$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        res = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            if intervals[i][0] < intervals[i-1][1]:
                res += 1
                intervals[i][1] = min(intervals[i][1], intervals[i-1][1])
        return res
```
#### Analysis
##### Time Complexity: $O(nlogn)$
1. Sort: $O(nlogn)$
2. Loop: $O(n)$
##### Space Complexity: $O(n)$
