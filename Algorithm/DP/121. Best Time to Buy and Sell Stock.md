## Note
### Method 1: Greedy
To employ a greedy strategy, it is essential to identify the minimum value on the left and the maximum value on the right.
#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        
        min_ = prices[0]
        res = 0

        for i in prices[1:]:
            if i < min_:
                min_ = i

            res = max(res, i - min_)

        return res
```
#### Analysis
##### Time Complexity: $O(n)$
##### Space Complexity: $O(1)$

### Method 2: DP
$dp[i][0]$ represents the maximum cash earned on the $i^{th}$ day when holding stocks, while $dp[i][1]$ signifies the maximum cash earned by not holding stocks on the $i^{th}$ day.

When holding the stock on the $i^{th}$ day, two situations arise:

- If we held the stock on the ${i - 1}^{th}$ day, we continue holding it: $dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0]$
- If we didn't hold the stock on the ${i - 1}^{th}$ day, we buy the stock on the current day: $dp[i][0] = - prices[i]$

When not holding the stock on the $i^{th}$ day, two situations arise:

- If we didn't hold stocks on day $i-1$, maintain the status quo, and the cash obtained is the same as if we didn't hold stocks yesterday: $dp[i - 1][1]$
- If we sell the stock on day $i$, the cash received is the sum obtained after selling at today's stock price: $prices[i] + dp[i - 1][0]$
#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(prices) == 0:
            return 0

        dp = [[0] * 2 for _ in range(len(prices))]

        dp[0][0] = -prices[0]
        dp[0][1] = 0

        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            dp[i][0] = max(dp[i - 1][0], - prices[i])
            dp[i][1] = max(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][0] + prices[i])

        return dp[-1][1]
```
