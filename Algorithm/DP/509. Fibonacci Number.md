## Note
1. **Identify the meaning of the dp array (dp table) and its indices:** dp[i], where i represents the i-th Fibonacci number.
    
2. **Determine the recurrence relation:** The recurrence relation is given by dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2].
    
3. **Establish how the dp array is initialized:** Initialize the dp array with dp[0] = 0 and dp[1] = 1.
    
4. **Decide on the traversal order:** Traverse the dp array from the front to the back.
    
5. **Provide examples to deduce the dp array:**
    
    - For the 0th Fibonacci number, dp[0] = 0 (base case).
    - For the 1st Fibonacci number, dp[1] = 1 (base case).
    - For the 2nd Fibonacci number, dp[2] = dp[1] + dp[0] = 1.
    - For the 3rd Fibonacci number, dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] = 2.
    - And so on.
### Method 1: DP

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def fib(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0:
            return 0
            
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 0
        dp[1] = 1
        res = 0

        for i in range(n):
            if i > 1:
                dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
            
        res = dp[n-1] + dp[n-2]

        return res
```
