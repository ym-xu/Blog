## Note
### Method 1: DP
First, let's analysis the problem:

| $i^{th}$ stair| methods |
| -------- | ------ |
| 1        | 1      |
| 2        | 2      |
| 3        | 3      |
| 4        | 5      |
| ...         |    ...    |
  
Because we can only take 1 step or 2 steps, the result for the i-th step is only related to the previous two steps. As shown in the table above, we can conclude that starting from the third stair, dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2].

1. **Identify the meaning of the dp array (dp table) and its indices:** To reach the $i^{th}$ stair, we have dp[i] ways.
    
2. **Determine the recurrence relation:** Since we can only take 1 step or 2 steps, the result for the $i^{th}$ stair is only related to the previous two stairs. As shown in the table above, we can conclude that starting from the third stair, dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2].
    
3. **Establish how the dp array is initialized:** In this problem, when n >= 1, we initialize dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 2.
    
4. **Decide on the traversal order:** From the front to the back.
    
5. **Provide examples to deduce the dp array**
    
    - For the 1st stair, dp[1] = 1 (base case).
    - For the 2nd stair, dp[2] = 2 (base case).
    - For the 3rd stair, dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] = 3.
    - For the 4th stair, dp[4] = dp[3] + dp[2] = 5.
    - And so on.
#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:

        if n == 1: return 1
        
        dp = [0] * (n+1)
        dp[1] = 1
        dp[2] =2

        for i in range(3, n+1):
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]

        return dp[n]
```

##### Time Complexity: $O(n)$
##### Space Complexity: $O(n)$

        dp[0] = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, 3):
               dp[i] += dp[i - j]

        return dp[n]
