## Note
Similar to [[121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock|121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock]]
### Method 1: Greedy
#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        
        max_ = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            max_ += max(prices[i] - prices[i-1], 0)

        return max_
```
#### Analysis
##### Time Complexity: $O(n)$
##### Space Complexity: $O(1)$

### Method 2: DP
The distinction from the situation described in problem [[121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock|121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock]] is that, if you decide to purchase a stock on the $i^{th}$ day, the cash received is derived from the cash earned by not holding the stock yesterday minus the current day's stock price: $dp[i - 1][1] - prices[i]$.
#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:

        dp = [[0] * 2 for _ in range(len(prices))]

        dp[0][0] = -prices[0]
        dp[0][1] = 0

        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            dp[i][0] = max(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1] - prices[i])
            dp[i][1] = max(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][0] + prices[i])

        return dp[-1][1]
```
