## Note
### Method 1: DP

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 1

        for coin in coins:
            for i in range(coin, amount + 1):
                dp[i] += dp[i - coin]

        return dp[amount]
```
#### Analysis
##### Time Complexity: $O(m * n)$
##### Space Complexity: $O(m)$
