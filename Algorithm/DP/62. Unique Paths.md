## Note
### Method 1: DP
1. **Identify the meaning of the dp array (dp table) and its indices:** It means that starting from (0, 0), there are dp[i][j] different paths to (i, j).
    
2. **Determine the recurrence relation:** $dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]$
    
3. **Establish how the dp array is initialized:** $dp[0][i:n] = 1$, $dp[i:m][0] = 1$
    
4. **Decide on the traversal order:** Traverse layer by layer from left to right
    
5. **Provide examples to deduce the dp array**
#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]

        for i in range(n): 
            dp[0][i] = 1
        for i in range(m):
            dp[i][0] = 1

        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(1,m):
                dp[j][i] = dp[j - 1][i] + dp[j][i - 1]

        return dp[m-1][n-1]
```
#### Analysis
##### Time Complexity: $O(n * m)$
##### Space Complexity: $O(n * m)$
