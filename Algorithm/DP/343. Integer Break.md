## Note
### Method 1: DP
1. **Identify the meaning of the dp array (dp table) and its indices:** The maximum product obtained by splitting the number i is represented by dp[i].
    
2. **Determine the recurrence relation:** dp[i] = max({dp[i], (i - j) * j, dp[i - j] * j})
    
3. **Establish how the dp array is initialized:** dp[0] = dp[1] = 0, dp[2] = 1
    
4. **Decide on the traversal order:** Since dp[i] relies on the state of dp[i - j], the traversal of i must proceed from the beginning to the end. The calculation for dp[i] depends on having dp[i - j] values before dp[i].
    
5. **Provide examples to deduce the dp array:** For instance, if we consider the product of 2 * 4, it can be expressed as 2 * dp[4] = 2 * 2 * 2, leveraging the precomputed results stored in dp for multiple numbers.
#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def integerBreak(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (n+1)
        dp[2] = 1

        for i in range(3, n+1):
            for j in range(1, i):
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], (i - j) * j, dp[i - j] * j)
        
        return dp[n]
```
#### Analysis
##### Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$
##### Space Complexity: $O(n)$
