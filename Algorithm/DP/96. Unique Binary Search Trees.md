## Note
### Method 1: DP
1. **Identify the meaning of the dp array (dp table) and its indices:** The number of binary search trees formed by nodes from 1 to i is represented by dp[i].
    
2. **Determine the recurrence relation:** dp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j]
    
3. **Establish how the dp array is initialized:** dp[0] = 1
    
4. **Decide on the traversal order:** From the recurrence relation: dp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j], it can be observed that the state of having i nodes depends on the states of nodes before i.
    
5. **Provide examples to deduce the dp array**
#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (n+1)
        dp[0] = 1

        for i in range(1, n+1):
            for j in range(1, i+1):
                dp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i-j]
                
        return dp[n]
```
#### Analysis
##### Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$
##### Space Complexity: $O(n)$
