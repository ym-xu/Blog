## Note

### Method 1: KMP
Use the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm to generate the next array for the needle string. This array aids in identifying the optimal position to shift during the comparison of the two strings.
#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:

        next = [0] * len(needle)
        self.kmp(next, needle)

        j = 0
        for i in range(len(haystack)):
            while j > 0 and haystack[i] != needle[j]:
                j = next[j - 1]
            if haystack[i] == needle[j]:
                j += 1
            if j == len(needle):
                return i - len(needle) + 1
        return -1
        
    def kmp(self, next, s):
      j = 0
      next[0] = 0
      for i in range(1, len(s)):
          while j > 0 and s[i] != s[j]:
              j = next[j - 1]
          if s[i] == s[j]:
              j += 1

          next[i] = j
```
